# Ethan Wolfe — Portfolio

A modern, high-performance personal website showcasing my work, experience, and skills. Built with semantic HTML, handcrafted CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — fast, responsive, and packed with subtle polish.

> Live site: (add your GitHub Pages URL here once deployed)

## ✨ Highlights
- Sleek, responsive layout with glassmorphism accents
- Animated experience timeline with clear career progression
- Interactive hero with typing effect and smooth scrolling
- Theme switcher (light/dark) with persisted preference
- Particle background and tasteful motion (optimized for performance)
- Reading progress bar and section reveal animations
- Accessibility-focused (keyboard navigation, reduced motion)
- Fun easter eggs: `showMeTheCode()`, Konami code secret mode

## 🚀 Run Locally (Windows / PowerShell)
Choose one of the following:

### Option A: VS Code Live Server (Recommended)
1. Open this folder in VS Code
2. Install the "Live Server" extension (by Ritwick Dey)
3. Right‑click `index.html` → Open with Live Server

### Option B: Python simple HTTP server
From the project directory:

```powershell
# If you have the 'py' launcher (common on Windows)
py -m http.server 5500

# Or, if Python is on PATH as 'python'
python -m http.server 5500
```
Then open http://localhost:5500 in your browser.

## 🧩 Customization
- Content: edit `index.html` (text, sections, links)
- Styles: tweak `styles.css` (colors, spacing, animations)
- Scripts: update `script.js` (typing words, thresholds, timings)
  - Change typing words by updating the `data-words` attribute on the `.typing-text` element in HTML
  - Toggle particles in `script.js` by including/removing the particle canvas
  - Theme defaults are persisted via `localStorage`

## 🔒 Accessibility & Performance
- IntersectionObserver-driven reveal animations (no layout thrash)
- Reduced motion support: respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Keyboard navigation with focus management on mobile nav
- Lazy-loaded imagery hooks and throttled/optimized scroll handlers

## 🥚 Easter Eggs
- In the browser console, run:
  - `showMeTheCode()` — prints build info and returns a message
  - `changeTheme('light')` or `changeTheme('dark')`
- Enter the Konami code on the page to unlock a rainbow secret mode
